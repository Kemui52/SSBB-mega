# SSBB Mega-Sized Edits

My personal edits for Brawl to make up for the lack of a proper invulnerability code. Fighters I mod get super armor added to as many animations as possible, stomp sounds, screen shakes, slowed down animations to match size and voice, and ultimately, constant attack bubbles with item vore. 'Cause why not? Subspace Emissary stage collision will also be edited to accomodate giants when needed (and when l get to it).

Fighter progress can be seen in Noting.txt under "Progress", but a lot of the file is personal notes and reminders, as well as lists for what other mods I use but aren't sharing here.
