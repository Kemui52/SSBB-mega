# SSBB Mega-Sized Edits

My personal edits for Brawl to make up for the lack of a proper invulnerability code. Fighters I mod get super armor added to as many animations as possible, stomp sounds, screen shakes, slowed down animations to match size and voice, and ultimately, constant attack bubbles with item vore. 'Cause why not? Subspace Emissary stage collision will also be edited to accomodate giants when needed (and when l get to it).

Fighter progress can be seen in Noting.txt under "Progress", but a lot of the file is personal notes and reminders, as well as lists for what other mods I use but aren't sharing here.

There are also event match edits, but they might not make sense unless you have the same model swops that I do.

## How is This Installed?

Inject each file manually or sort them individually to an extracted disc filesystem. The general folders line up, but you'll have to make sure sub-folders and certain names match.

**Fighter** files go in their respective fighter folders. MEGA files have all features, but the MEGA_ part of the name should be removed when adding to your game.

**Stage** files with numbers go in the "adventure" folder, while the named ones go under "melee". The "melee" stages are widened out for more stomping range.

*System* files exist to remove certain global animations so the fighter files are used, as well as contain some event match edits. Though, the event matches won't make sense unless you find the same models I have. It is recommended to only use **common4** and **common5**.

*Menu2* contains image and text edits for the event matches. Don't worry about it unless you want to try the events.

### Tools Used?

Compressor v0.33 to edit PSAs.

BrawlBox 0.78 for stage and general PAC editing, with 0.68b for its attack bubble flag listings.

Sawndz Super for voice clip injection (not included).

Stage Switcher for placing melee stages where I want them (not included).

### Credits?

(I can't believe I kept track of what l downloaded, but never grabbed the authors. Shame on me...)

Bowser uses various anims from Kruna Animations.

Charizard uses Catch anims from Charizard Behemoth and ThrowLow anim from Charizard Hungry.
